Mac\+Pan is a Pac-\/\+Man–inspired game built using ncurses. ~\newline
 The objective is to freeze and eat every enemy on the map. When enemies are unfrozen, the player needs to avoid them and search for a power-\/up that lets them freeze them again. ~\newline
 Both difficulty modes use maps with the same overall dimensions, but Easy mode has wider pathways and only two enemies, while Hard mode has narrower pathways and eight enemies. ~\newline
 The game also includes portals and power-\/ups. ~\newline
 \subsection*{Environmental Interactions}

When standing over a portal, the player can activate it using the space bar, and then will be teleported to the other corner of the map. ~\newline
 When standing over a power-\/up, pressing 1 or 2 freezes half of the enemies. ~\newline
 \subsection*{N\+PC Interaction}

When standing over a power-\/up, pressing 1 freezes all enemies with odd indices, and 2 freezes those with even indices. ~\newline
 If the player sprite collides with an unfrozen enemy sprite, the player loses a life. ~\newline
 If the player sprite collides with a frozen enemy sprite, the enemy is eaten. ~\newline
